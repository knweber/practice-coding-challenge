# practice-coding-challenge
This app was built in order to practice coding challenges that may be given by a prospective employer. I built this app following the instructions found in Conde Nast's public "Technical Challenge" repo, which can be found at https://github.com/conde-nast-international/cnid-tech-tests. I chose option 1, for which I created an app that would take data from a JSON file (which I imported into a remote database on mLab) and create an index page to show all of the articles included in the JSON file, and a specific page for each article. 

## Instructions
1. Clone repo to local computer
2. Run ``npm install``
3. Run ``nodemon`` to start server
4. Open up localhost:3000
